# PBS Learning

## Introduction

Imperial College's HPC system is great for you to use the brand new hardware and machines, but it's not user-friendly and 
confusing in many aspects:

* The PBS queuing system is easy to understand but hard to use and debug
* The HPC wiki is not that detailed and don't have enough hand-on scripts or programs
* The module system is not a modern way to handle package dependencies and has subtle bugs if you don't take care
* ...

In this tutorial, I'll help you clarify those confusing points, guide you to understand the principles, and finally use 
the HPC system to build a modern application (like Deep Learning).
